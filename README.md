Green Walker is an iOS app that helps eco-friendly people discovering routing paths across big cities that avoid the most polluted areas.

This app was designed and implemented in a 3-hours hackaton at EIT Digital Summer School on Big Data Analytics held in Stockholm, Sweden, from 4-16 August 2019.
